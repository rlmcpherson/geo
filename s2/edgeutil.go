// VertexCrossing reports whether, given two edges AB and CD where at least two vertices are identical
// (i.e. RobustCrossing(a,b,c,d) == 0), the
// two edges "cross" in a such a way that point-in-polygon containment tests
// can be implemented by counting the number of edge crossings.  The basic
// rule is that a "crossing" occurs if AB is encountered after CD during a
// CCW sweep around the shared vertex starting from a fixed reference point.
//
// Note that according to this rule, if AB crosses CD then in general CD
// does not cross AB.  However, this leads to the correct result when
// counting polygon edge crossings.  For example, suppose that A,B,C are
// three consecutive vertices of a CCW polygon.  If we now consider the edge
// crossings of a segment BP as P sweeps around B, the crossing number
// changes parity exactly when BP crosses BA or BC.

//  (3) If exactly one of a,b equals one of c,d, then exactly one of
//      VC(a,b,c,d) and VC(c,d,a,b) is true
